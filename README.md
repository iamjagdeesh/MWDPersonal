# Vector space modeling of MovieLens & IMDB movie data

This project demonstrates the following Multimedia and Web Database concepts using MovieLens and IMDB movie data:

- Multi-dimensional data representation
- Dimensionality reduction using SVD, LDA and PCA
- Feature significance using TF and TF-IDF measures
- Latent semantic analysis using SVD, PCA and LDA
- Tensor decomposition analysis using CP decomposition
- Node ranking/significance using Personalized PageRank
- Movie Recommendation system using SVD, LDA, PCA, Tensor decomposition and PageRank
- Probabilistic Relevance Feedback
- Multi-dimensional index structures using LSH
- Nearest Neighbor search using LSH
- Nearest Neighbor based relevance feedback using query rewrite technique
- Movie classification using SVM, Decision Trees and KNN classifiers

Phase 1 - Multi-dimentional data representation, Feature significance using TF and TF-IDF measures. This phase is included in phase 2 as phase 2 is a continuation of it.

Phase 2 - Dimentionality reduction (SVD, LDA and PCA), Latent semantics analysis (SVD, PCA and LDA), Tensor decomposition analysis using CP decomposition, Node ranking/significance using Personalized PageRank

Phase 3 - Movie Recommendation system (SVD, LDA, PCA, Tensor decomposition and PageRank), Probablistic Relevance Feedback, Multi-dimensional index structures using LSH, Nearest neighbor search using LSH, Nearest Neighbor based relevance feedback using query rewrite technique, Movie classification (SVM, Decision Trees and KNN classifiers)
